# Troubleshooting

> **Note**: This page documents issues with the **default benchmark (flashinfer-bench)**. If you've swapped benchmarks via [Porting](porting.md), see your benchmark's docs for its specific issues.

## flashinfer-bench (default benchmark)

### CUPTI Driver Mismatch

Local benchmarking uses CUPTI profiling by default via `cupti-python`. There are two fallback scenarios:

- **`cupti-python` not installed or version < 13.0**: Benchmarking gracefully falls back to CUDA events at import time. This works fine but produces noisier measurements, especially with low iteration counts.
- **`cupti-python >= 13.0` installed, but CUDA driver < 13.0**: CUPTI calls fail at runtime with `NotSupportedError`, causing all workloads to report RUNTIME_ERROR. This is **not** caught by the current fallback logic.

**Workarounds**: Ensure CUDA driver >= 13.0 when `cupti-python >= 13.0` is installed, or use the Modal backend (`--backend modal`). An upstream fix in flashinfer-bench is pending.

### flashinfer-bench Version

`pyproject.toml` pins `flashinfer-bench` to the git main branch (not PyPI's v0.1.2, which lags behind). Both `flashinfer-bench` and `cupti-python>=13.0.0` are installed automatically via `pip install .`.

### TVM FFI Builder: No External Library Linking

The TVMFFIBuilder (used for CUDA/C++ solutions) compiles `.cu`/`.cpp` files via `tvm_ffi.cpp.build()` but does not pass `extra_ldflags` to the linker. Libraries like cuBLAS, cuDNN, etc. cannot be linked at compile time.

**Don't route around this with `dlopen`/`dlsym` of cuBLAS / cuDNN.** That is a delegation shortcut the benchmark's validity rule explicitly bans (the `benchmark` SKILL's "Valid solution: write your own kernel" section). In closed-loop campaigns the master's pre-archive audit greps the build for `cublas|cudnn` and rejects archive with `library-call-suspected`. Build your own kernel — header-only **CUTLASS** is allowed and already on the include path, and the DSLs (Triton / TileLang / CuTe DSL) are the standard route.
