"""scripts/campaign_start.py — initialize a closed-loop AKO4X campaign branch.

Performs the mechanical setup that isolates master CC from dev-facing root
docs and stages a clean commit-curation surface for wrap-up:

1. Pre-flight: must be on `main`, working tree clean
2. Create branch `campaign/<operator>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>`
3. Replace root `CLAUDE.md` with `master/MASTER.md` content
   (so master CC's auto-loaded root context IS the orchestrator protocol)
4. Replace root `README.md` with a campaign stub
   (avoids "no README" footguns from IDE / GitHub repo page)
5. Commit the swap with a self-documenting metadata-rich message —
   the wrap-up phase reads this commit message to recover campaign
   identity without asking the user

The wrap-up procedure (run when the campaign concludes, not the concern
of master CC during optimization) is documented in the comment block
immediately below this docstring — readable to any human / dev CC /
master CC opening this file.

Convention: `family == operator name kebab-cased` (e.g. operator
`mla_paged_decode_h16_ckv512_kpe64_ps1` → family
`mla-paged-decode-h16-ckv512-kpe64-ps1`). The deferred cross-operator
sharing extension is left for a future version.

Usage:
    python scripts/campaign_start.py --operator <name> [--gpu b200] [--backend modal] [--mode 2]

Example:
    python scripts/campaign_start.py \\
        --operator mla_paged_decode_h16_ckv512_kpe64_ps1 \\
        --gpu b200 --backend modal --mode 2

# =============================================================================
# CAMPAIGN WRAP-UP PROTOCOL
# =============================================================================
# Run when the campaign concludes — applies regardless of who does it (master
# CC, a fresh dev CC, or the user directly). Wrap-up is not optimization work
# and not master CC's mandatory job; surface this protocol to whoever asks.
#
# The campaign-mode commit at the base of the branch (created by this script)
# MUST NOT enter main — wrap-up drops it.
#
# 1. Read the campaign-mode commit message for context:
#        git log main..HEAD --format=%B | head -30
#    The bottommost (oldest) commit is `campaign-mode: ...` and carries
#    operator / family / backend / gpu / mode / base-sha — recovers campaign
#    identity (including the Mode 2/3 it locked) without asking the user.
#
# 2. Enumerate campaign commits:
#        git log main..HEAD --oneline
#
# 3. Classify each commit. Typical buckets:
#    - campaign-mode (branch base) ................... DROP (must not enter main)
#    - round-N family=... archive ...  ............... usually KEEP (output)
#    - harness improvements (master/ scripts/ tests/)  usually KEEP
#    - harness-ledger.md appends ..................... usually KEEP
#    - _failed/<round-id>/ additions ................. usually KEEP (forensic)
#    - doc / README iterations during campaign ....... case-by-case (squash noise)
#    Mode caveat: in a Mode-2 campaign (see the campaign-mode commit's `Mode:`
#    field) the harness is held static — a round commit touching templates/ /
#    scripts/ / master/ is a BUG per MASTER.md step 10, not a "harness
#    improvement to keep". Scrutinize any such Mode-2 commit before keeping it.
#
# 4. Present the classification + planned action to the user as a table.
#    Do NOT execute without approval — wrap-up is the only time you touch
#    shared git history; treat it as risky-action.
#
# 5. Execute the approved plan. Common shapes:
#    - Drop just campaign-mode, keep everything else:
#        git rebase --onto <campaign-mode-sha>^ <campaign-mode-sha> HEAD
#    - Selective edits across multiple commits:
#        git rebase -i <campaign-mode-sha>^
#    - Preserve full history (least surgical, leaves both swap + undo on record):
#        git revert <campaign-mode-sha>
#
# 6. Verify with `git diff main` against the cleaned branch and show the
#    net diff to the user. Catch: stray CLAUDE.md / README.md residue
#    from campaign-mode, any experiments/ content (should be gitignored),
#    reference/ files in the wrong operator dir.
#
# 7. Build per-campaign archive bundle into `experiments/<operator>/`
#    (gitignored, local-only). Mirror the layout of any prior campaign
#    bundle in `experiments/`. Standard contents:
#      - README.md ........................ campaign identity (operator,
#        family, GPU, backend, CUDA / Triton / image versions, workload
#        count, expert baseline name, campaign start/end), result curve
#        per round, phase-1 wall-clock durations, accepted harness edits
#        table, artifact layout, reproducibility note.
#      - child-envs/<round-label>/ ........ full child env dirs from
#        `~/Project/AKO/ako4x-run-<round-label>-*/`. Compress (`tar
#        -cJf <round-label>.tar.xz`) only if a round bloats past ~100 MB
#        (e.g. trajectory snapshots of large auxiliary files); the MLA
#        r2 precedent compressed 3.6 GB → 354 MB.
#      - master-claude-sessions/AKO4X-cwd/<uuid>.jsonl — this
#        campaign's master CC session memory from
#        `~/.claude/projects/-home-...-AKO4X/`. Filter by date if
#        multiple sessions exist.
#      - sub-claude-sessions/r{N}/ ........ per-round sub CC local
#        session memory from
#        `~/.claude/projects/-home-...-ako4x-run-<round-label>/`.
#      - reference-snapshot/<family>/ ..... snapshot of
#        `reference/<family>/` as of campaign end (variant archive +
#        README + baseline + _failed/ if any).
#      - ledger-extract.md ................ entries from
#        `master/harness-ledger.md` that this campaign produced. The
#        global ledger remains canonical (single source of truth for the
#        co-evolved harness state); this is a per-campaign convenience
#        view so the gitignored archive bundle is self-contained for
#        retrospective reading. Filter by date range
#        (campaign-mode-commit date → today) plus inspection — entries
#        don't carry a canonical `family=` tag, so use scope path /
#        edit-id keyword to disambiguate when needed.
#
#    Do this BEFORE step 8's `git branch -D`. The child envs and the
#    branch's curated git history are the most retrievable just before
#    deletion.
#
#    After the archive bundle is built AND `diff -rq` confirms each
#    archived child-envs/<round-label>/ is byte-identical to its origin
#    (`~/Project/AKO/ako4x-run-<round-label>-*/`), **delete the
#    originals**: `rm -rf ~/Project/AKO/ako4x-run-<round-label>-*`.
#    Semantics is archive-then-delete, not archive-then-leave — child
#    envs accumulate disk + clutter parent dir across campaigns
#    otherwise. The diff verification is the safety gate; without it,
#    skip the delete and ask the user. (Earlier precedent: rmsnorm-h128
#    wrap-up missed this step; gemm-n2048-k4096 wrap-up retroactively
#    cleaned both campaigns.)
#
# 8. Land:
#        git checkout main && git merge --ff-only <branch>
#        git push origin main
#        git branch -D <branch>
#        git push origin --delete <branch>
#
# Constraints:
# - Never force-push to main.
# - Never drop commits the user hasn't approved.
# - experiments/<operator>/ is gitignored (local-only) — don't try to fold.
# - If a _failed/<round-id>/ commit exists, surface it explicitly during
#   classification — forensic records that the user should consciously
#   keep or drop, not silently dropped.
