"""Thin IO layer for the AKO4X closed-loop master agent.

This file is intentionally NOT where decisions live. The master CC makes
accept / reject / archive / quarantine decisions in its prompt; master.py
exposes mechanical helpers (spawn, run sub, parse transcripts, write
artifacts to disk).

Functions, see MASTER.md for round-flow context:

  init_campaign(...)             — Round-0 archive setup (idempotent)
  read_campaign_mode(...)        — read locked mode (2 or 3) from baseline.json
  spawn_child(...)               — derive a child env via spawn.py
  run_sub_phase1(...)            — drive sub through phase-1 (claude --print)
  send_retrospective_prompt(...) — drive sub through phase-2 (claude --resume; Mode 3 only)
  archive_variant(...)           — land a successful variant under reference/<family>/
  archive_failed(...)            — land a crash/timeout transcript under reference/<family>/_failed/
  append_ledger(...)             — append one line to harness-ledger.md

Master CC reads sub's proposals directly from `<child>/PROPOSALS.md` via its
own Read tool — there is no master.py parser for that file. The phase-2
transcript at `<child>/.ako/phase2-transcript.jsonl` is preserved as a soft
fallback for master CC to consult if PROPOSALS.md is absent or malformed.
